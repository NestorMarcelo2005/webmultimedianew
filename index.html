            <h2>French and Belgian Towns Distribute Free Chickens to Reduce Food Waste</h2>
            <p>Towns in France and Belgium have introduced an innovative solution to combat food waste—giving away free chickens. The initiative, which started in Pincé, France, in 2012 and later expanded to Colmar in 2015, encourages households to feed kitchen scraps to their birds while benefiting from fresh eggs. The program has gained popularity, with thousands of families participating.</p>

                <div class="text-side">
                    <h3>Success in France and Belgium</h3>
                    <p>Colmar's program began when Gilbert Meyer, then-president of Colmar Agglomération, pledged to provide chickens to residents. In partnership with local farms, households received two hens and committed to their care. By 2022, all 20 municipalities in Colmar Agglomération had joined, distributing over 5,200 chickens and diverting an estimated 273 tonnes of food waste from landfills.</p>
                    <p>Belgium has also embraced the idea. Cities like Mouscron and Antwerp, as well as Limburg province, have distributed chickens to thousands of families. Some residents had to sign agreements not to eat the chickens for at least two years. The initiative has not only reduced waste but also provided a steady source of fresh eggs.</p>

            </div>

            <p>While the program has been successful in France and Belgium, experts caution against broad expansion. Paul Behrens, a professor at Oxford University, warns of the risks of bird flu and the need for strict regulations on keeping chickens in enclosed spaces. In the U.S., Yale University's Mark Bomford argues that giving away chickens wouldn’t be practical, as low-income households may lack the necessary resources like space, feed, and time to care for them.</p>
            <p>Additionally, some researchers worry that keeping chickens could unintentionally increase food waste. People might feel justified in wasting food, thinking their scraps are being put to use. Composting is considered a more effective solution in some cases.</p>

        <section class="article">
            <p>One major argument in favor of such initiatives is the rising cost of eggs. In places like California and New York, a dozen eggs can cost around $9. In contrast, some countries still have relatively affordable eggs. A global map showing the average cost of eggs highlights the disparities: in the U.S. and parts of Europe, prices have surged due to inflation and bird flu outbreaks, whereas in regions like India and Mexico, eggs remain a cheap staple. Providing free chickens could be particularly useful in areas where egg prices are prohibitively high.</p>

        <section class="article">
            <p>One alternative is chicken rentals. Christine and Brian Templeton of "Rent The Chicken" in New Hampshire offer a service that allows families to temporarily care for chickens and collect fresh eggs without a long-term commitment. This model provides an accessible way for people to experience raising chickens while mitigating the costs and responsibilities.</p>
            <p>Beyond sustainability, one of the most notable benefits of Colmar’s initiative is the sense of community it fosters. Neighbors help each other care for chickens, particularly during vacations, strengthening social bonds. According to Eric Straumann, Colmar’s current president, this communal spirit has contributed to the program’s longevity and success.</p>
            <p>The free chicken initiative in France and Belgium has effectively reduced food waste while providing fresh eggs. However, its expansion faces logistical and regulatory challenges. While alternative solutions like composting and chicken rentals may be more practical in some regions, Colmar’s success highlights the potential of community-driven approaches in tackling sustainability issues.</p>
